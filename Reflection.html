          </h2>
          <p>‘Woolly Web’ is the name of our group and working with my fellow teammates has been a blast! Keeping consistent with our weekly group calls, as well as efficiently communicating through teams, has been what I would say worked best for us. Everyone in the group has been extremely friendly, and open to discussion and helping each other whenever we were stuck or stumped on a certain section. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In my opinion, due to the team working together very effectively, there are only minor improvements that I can see possible for future assignments. Together as a group, I think we could have started the assignment earlier. &nbsp;Due to starting a little late, we may have given ourselves some undue stress earlier in the assignment. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our team is lucky enough to have a very skilled set of team members. Jo is amazing with her literacy ability, helping all team members edit their written portions of the assignment as well as tirelessly editing the full report. Thomas’s amazing confidence and speaking ability helped the group tremendously when it came to interviewing the IT professional. Robert’s communication skills when it came to effectively helping members through Microsoft Teams were of great importance to the group. Bronson's detailed knowledge base of IT helped greatly when it came to any of the technical aspects of the report and website, and Candice's amazing and effective research skills are clearly shown in her work within the report. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Working with ‘Woolly Web’ has truly taught me just how important communication is within a group. With our group effectively and eagerly setting up our communication platform early (Microsoft Teams), we were able to easily set up our weekly group calls, as well as help each other with ease through the group channels that we have set up in our Teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Thomas Lucchese&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Group 4 ‘Woolly Webs’ has been awesome to work with. Everyone has been coming together in the meetings to share our ideas for assignment 2 as well as having lengthy discussions about our project idea. All members in the group are eager to help each other especially if a member is stuck or needs assistance with an area that they are working on. It was also great to see group members volunteering to work on certain parts of the assignment rather than someone allocating on behalf of the group.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It was also great to see that each member of the team had their strengths to share with the team. Jo is always happy and eager to proof-read and edit group member’s work. Bronson’s current experience with technology, he brought great ideas for our project idea as well as setting up the GitHub repository. Mitchell also brought great ideas to our meetings with his experience in IT and was also eager to assist members where needed. Robert has been great with communication especially answering questions where other members may be unsure or needed clarification. Candice bought her enthusiasm to the team which is especially evident in the sections she chose to work on are well written with lots of research done.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Whilst I am familiar with using teams especially for work, I did find it a little challenging to use alongside my work account (which I really do need to use) as sometimes, notifications or announcements for the groups did not appear on my mobile device which I am mainly on especially when I am at work during weekdays.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Jo Haythornthwaite&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Our team worked together well in this group project. &nbsp;Even though we come from a variety of backgrounds, with differing skill sets, locations, ages, and future goals, being a part of this group has been a positive experience. I believe that our success in working as a team was because we were all committed to making the best contribution that we were able and doing our absolute best.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There are some minor improvements that we will be able to implement for future assessments. I have not worked with the MS Team platform to the extent that that we have had to for this assessment, so I look forward to expanding my knowledge of this platform. Also, now that we are more aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each individual member, we will be able to ask for assistance more quickly if we have a query. &nbsp;This should benefit the group moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In working as part of our team, each member has contributed in an extremely positive way. Robert’s life skills and professional experience has contributed to our team discussion in a very practical way. Candice completed her research efficiently and to a high standard, as well as actively assisting on the team discussion board. Bronson has brought strong technical knowledge to our team. &nbsp;Not only has used this knowledge for the benefit of the team, he has been willing to share this knowledge, so that we are all able to improve our technical skills. &nbsp;Likewise, Mitchel has brough strong technical skills to our team, as well as providing the contact and setting up the interview with the IT professional. &nbsp;the way Thomas conducted the interview with the IT Professional, as well as his research and contribution to the Woolly Web App. Were excellent.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I have learnt that working in groups can be a positive and rewarding experience, as many of my past experiences have not been positive.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Bronson Billing&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>The entire assignment went far smoother than I expected. Most of my prior experiences in groups have been negative. There were no conflicts or notable issues. Everybody did well and used their skills to improve the team’s work.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I feel that we could have gotten to the assignment work a bit faster. Much of the first week was not spent working on the assignment but was used to get to know each other as well as organise meetings and members. This issue was largely unavoidable and has likely already fixed itself for the next assignment since we all have experience working with each other and have well established meeting times.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I was surprised by how smoothly the teamwork aspect of the assignment went. Most of my prior experience in teams was at school, so often the team was not motivated to do what needed to be done as they did not want to be there in the first place. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The most important thing I learned about groups is that teamwork can be positive. I feel that a lot of my apprehension and stress around teamwork will probably be reduced in the future due to this.</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Candice Nafarrete&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>At first, I was hesitant with the group, but everyone was very polite and welcoming which helped me become more comfortable in contributing to the best of my knowledge. I admit I was surprised at how well the entire project played out, communication was greatly demonstrated within the group and when there was an issue, it was handled fairly. I agree with the others in that certain parts of the project could have been planned or even finalised early, but of course things happen out of our control. However, it was communicated when plans changed, and help was given when needed. The group overall was great in demonstrating differentiating skills and expertise which complemented the result of the team project. I believe in the next team project we will learn from any discrepancies and from our A1 and A2 feedbacks, to improve and/or avoid any mishaps.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Robert Ricketts&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Our first group project was challenging from a personal perspective. Learning a new platform such as MS Teams was difficult.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I felt that the second assessment followed too closely to the first, with the timing to receive our individual grades needed, impacting the time available to complete assessment two.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our group had some great core attributes. Jo has excellent experience with writing, grammar and reporting style which has seen the assessment develop with structure at a standard expected for a tertiary assessment. Bronson took the initiative to set up the group and the repository for GitHub. Bronson’s experience with programming and technology easily shone through and his personality made him a natural leader. Mitchell’s experience in IT was a major factor in the group’s direction and assessment. He always offered well thought out, balanced discussion within the team meetings. Thomas had the enthusiasm and energy to take on a challenging part of the assessment with an eagerness to help others and further new skills in programming language. Candice brought a balanced and calm style to the project and assessment. Her task outline and information are well written and referenced.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A friendly group, with a well-balanced skill set has made it markedly easier to complete assessment two and future assessments. It has been a pleasure being part of group 4.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Group Feedback </span>
          </h2>
          <p>As can be seen from our individual feedback, working on this assignment as a team has been an extremely positive experience. &nbsp;The individual skills of each team member combined well to cover all the assignment requirements in a way that we hope has been successful.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The individual feedback indicates that there were some minor challenges that were faced. &nbsp;We could have started working on the assignment a little earlier. &nbsp;However, we are confident that this will not be an issue for the next assignment, as we now know each other a little better and are familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses. Also, working in the Teams environment was a little challenging for those of us who were unfamiliar, or faced technical issues, with this platform. &nbsp;Although there is still a great deal for some of us to learn when working on this platform, we are confident that we will feel more comfortable for the best assessment. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe that working together on this assignment has shown us that group work can be a positive experience, with the individual feedback reflecting our group feedback. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
