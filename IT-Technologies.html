          </h2>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Introduction&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Blockchain is an idea that has existed for more than 30 years (History of blockchain, 2022). &nbsp;It was first implemented and created by a person or organisation calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Essentially, blockchain is simply an open-source, publicly accessible, unchangeable database that stores transactional information across thousands of nodes (What Is A Blockchain? | Blockchain Explained Simply, 2022), with this information stored through chunks of information, called blocks, that are tied together (Hayes, 2022).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that provides a means for transferring value over the internet (What Are Cryptocurrencies: Different Types. How They Work? | Blockchain Venture Capital Blufolio, 2022). &nbsp;As cryptocurrencies are without physical form, an intermediary such as a bank, is not required. &nbsp;The link between blockchain and cryptocurrencies is that blockchains exist for the purpose of enabling the cryptocurrency technology (Advantages and Disadvantages of Decentralized Blockchains, 2022). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">What does it do?&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>The current state of this technology is best described as disjointed and, for the most part, without specific direction. &nbsp;The reason for this disjointedness is that blockchain was created as a decentralised system, with there being dozens of different blockchains and nearly 20,000 different cryptocurrencies that exist on these blockchains (Kharpal, 2022). This decentralised system does, though, have the benefit of minimising potential fraud and allowing for faster transaction times, as well as resulting in increased financial efficiency &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Despite the disjointedness of the blockchain technology, there are two main general trends that can be identified. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The first trend relates to minimising electricity use, as well as the carbon footprint. &nbsp;A common criticism of cryptocurrency is how much electricity is used by the blockchain technology. As an example, Bitcoin, one of the most common forms of cryptocurrency that is powered by blockchain technology (Marr, 2022), is estimated to use 150 terawatt hours of electricity annually (Hinsdale, 2022), which is more electricity that is used by Argentina in a year. &nbsp;Although individual users may be unaware of the impact of this power usage on the carbon footprint, it is suggested that this usage may be a barrier to the large-scale adoption of the technology.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This high energy consumption of blockchain technology is due to the use of the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. &nbsp;Despite its high energy consumption, this blockchain technology protocol is important as PoW is the technology that makes digital transactions secure without having to rely on a third party (Lindsey, 2022). This is achieved by incentivising miners of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) to join the network by solving a cryptographic algorithm which, in turn, increases power and security. &nbsp;With so many devices competing to be the first to solve the algorithm, the resulting energy consumption is extremely high (Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: What's The Difference? 2022).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The trend that is developing in many new blockchains is an effort to make their technology more environmentally friendly by use of the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. PoS technology also makes digital transactions secure without having to rely on a third party. &nbsp;However, in contrast to PoW, PoS achieves this by the computer selecting the users for mining, based on the number of tokens or stakes that the user has in the network (Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: What's The Difference? 2022). &nbsp;Because the users are not competing, the energy consumption is substantially lower when using the PoW protocol. &nbsp;As an example, the second largest cryptocurrency, Ether, is transitioning their blockchain, Ethereum, from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that this will reduce the power usage of the blockchain by 99.95% (Duffy, 2021). Such a drastic decrease in network power usage has been very attractive for investors and has caused many other blockchains to adopt PoS as well.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The second general trend relating to the blockchain technology, and the use of cryptocurrency, is the desire by many for this currency to achieve the goal of widescale adoption and usage, with cryptocurrency equalling, or even surpassing money as the main method of exchange in the world. &nbsp;This trend creates both challenges and opportunities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Challenges facing this technology, if the technology were to achieve widespread adoption and use, include (5 Major Challenges Faced By Cryptocurrency, 2022):&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The complexity of this technology for many people</li>
            <li>Government regulation and legislation for blockchain, which is a decentralised technology, using cryptocurrency, that is not a legal monetary unit</li>
            <li>The volatility of cryptocurrency</li>
            <li>Security concerns that exist (despite the protocols already discussed)&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Opportunities and benefits of this technology may include (7 Benefits of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology - Oceanup.com, 2022):&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cryptocurrency is accessible to all&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Low transaction fees and instant payment&nbsp;</li>
            <li>A decentralised system&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Transparency&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">What is the likely impact?&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Two potential impacts are likely. &nbsp;Firstly, blockchain and cryptocurrency will undoubtably play an increasing role in the future. &nbsp;Secondly, if blockchain were to replace, or even encroach upon, our current monetary system, this disruptive technology will have a wide-ranging impact.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>With reference to the role of blockchain and cryptocurrency in the future, the degree of impact is likely to depend on the direction of the cryptocurrency market. &nbsp;If the market remains stagnant or stays low, the degree of impact for the majority may be minimal in the short to medium term. &nbsp;However, if the cryptocurrency market becomes more buoyant in the future this, along with the feature of accessibility, will likely have great impact as more potential investors enter the market.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As noted, blockchain and cryptocurrency have the potential to become a disruptive technology. As well as having the potential to disrupt the current banking systems, with Web 3.0 blockchain and cryptocurrencies have the potential to break down the monopolies that companies such as Microsoft and Amazon hold with their web hosting platforms. &nbsp;Certain blockchains, such as Internet Computer (ICP) have the potential change the way the internet functions by operating in a new and innovative way (What Is Internet Computer (ICP) Crypto? A Guide to the "Limitless" Project, 2022). If successful with its goals, ICP could replace AWS, Azure, all SQL and JSON databases, along with many other web-based technologies. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>With this potential disruption being reminiscent of the transition from entirely static webpages in the early stages of the internet (Web 1.0) to the more dynamic webpages (Web 2.0) (Sharma, 2022), the transition to a blockchain reliant internet (Web 3.0) could decentralise the server and cloud hosting industry by making it simpler and more economical for users to host content.&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">How will this affect you?&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>As someone who has interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, along with the fact that I have invested in cryptocurrency in the past, this technology will have an impact for me. &nbsp;I would hope to invest again in the future, with the goal of personally benefiting financially, as well as my family benefitting financially. &nbsp;However, I appreciate that with the volatility of this technology, there is always a financial risk. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As a disruptive technology, blockchain and cryptocurrency have the potential to replace web-based technologies. &nbsp;If this were to occur, it could lead to an increased level of decentralisation, along with the possibility of an increased level of automation. &nbsp;An increased level of decentralisation brings with it the potential employment opportunities. &nbsp;However, due to the increased level of automation there is also the potential for decreased employment.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As an example, should my employment opportunities in areas relating to Web 2.0 decrease, I would hope to find possible employment opportunities in Web 3.0 technologies with roles such as blockchain developer, blockchain solution architect (Career opportunities in Blockchain and the skills you need, 2022) and Cryptocurrency Analyst (Ullah and Angela Scott-Briggs, 2022).&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Conclusion</span>&nbsp;
          </h3>
          <p>This growing sector of technology will present both opportunities and challenges. Current and future exploration of opportunities with this open source and accessible technology will continue to be explored and developed in the light of its high energy use and volatility.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Introduction&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Cloud computing utilises the hardware, software and databases of host machines located in data centres throughout the world without having to manage your own servers. &nbsp;This allows access of files, applications and information remotely (The Benefits of Cloud Computing, 2022). &nbsp;Any electronic device that is connected to the internet can remotely access information, as if it was stored locally, providing opportunity for greater collaboration, flexibility, along with reduced software and hardware expenditure.&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">What Does it do?&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Cloud computing is made possible by a technology called virtualisation. Virtualisation is the creation of a digital only computer, which behaves like a physical computer with its own hardware (What is Virtualisation - Definition | Microsoft Azure, 2022). &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The physical hardware has a small overlay program called a hypervisor, or host machine. &nbsp;An operating system is then installed on top of the hypervisor which then becomes a virtual or guest machine (What is a Hypervisor? | VMware Glossary, 2022). The hypervisor allows the virtual machine to use all available resources as if it was a physical system. Many instances of virtual machines can be created per host machine which allows for the more efficient use of the available hardware and software. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>There are two main types of hypervisors, type 1 and type 2. A type 1 hypervisor acts as a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the hosts hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The most popular Type 1 Hypervisors are: VMware – vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation and KVM. Most of the Type 1 Hypervisors have a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allow the hot swap of enterprise CPU and memory modules, distributed resource schedulers that allow for load balancing as well as auto deployment. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Type 2 hypervisors, also known as hosted hypervisors, differ to type 1 as it is a virtual machine manager that is installed as a software application within an operating system. VMware and Oracle Virtual Box are the two most common type 2 hypervisors and usually installed on private machines where an individual would like to run another operating system on their home PC or laptop.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cloud based services can also be broken into three main subcategories:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Private Cloud&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Public Cloud&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Hybrid Cloud&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Private cloud computing is where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single user or organisation. The private cloud can be hosted within the organisations own data centre or co-located with a third-party facility. In general, the equipment, management, deployment and oversight are generally the responsibility of the organisation which allows for greater expense, but increased security, cost management and known hardware performance.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Public cloud-based host machines are in large data centres around the world, improving scalability, cost, efficiency and effective use of the installed hardware. Data centres would be host to hundreds of host computers or thousands of guest/ virtual computers. Datacentres can be in geographic regions specific to client needs as well as to allow redundant paths for the data they hold.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Public Cloud providers are usually categorised as follows:&nbsp;</p>

          <p id="isPasted">Hybrid Cloud is a computing environment where an organisation allows data and applications to be shared between and combine the use of both private and public clouds (What is Hybrid Cloud Computing – Definition | Microsoft Azure, 2022). It gives an organisation the ability to quickly scale processing and computing when demand exceeds the onsite private cloud and avoid the costs associated with expanding their private cloud by using public cloud facilities on a pay as you need basis.&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">What is the Likely Impact?&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Cloud based servers and data have and will continue to have an impact on individuals. Recently with the outbreak of covid, many businesses realised that remote work was the only viable alternative. This has created a greater need for working from home, with cloud-based applications and data being thrust into the spotlight. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The cloud-based model should have been a perfect fit, for those organisations already moved over to a public cloud system. Scalability and resourcing are a big factor in the feature set from a provider perspective. Businesses already in the cloud would have allowed continued operations with staff working from home or remotely, meetings taking place by video conferencing and network support also able to be managed remotely.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Providers would have seen a huge increase in resources required in a very short time period. Larger cloud providers should have been able to meet the immediate demand from clients, although in some cases found themselves caught short with shortages of their own in terms of hardware available, based on reduced component production and availability.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A common concern for many organisations moving to a cloud-based business model is security. Important company information or customer database leaks could prove financially catastrophic as well as legally with many countries having laws in place to fine corporations heavily if data is breached. A business needs to rely on the provider of the datacentre that their digital security protocols as well as their physical security procedures are robust. Providers, such as google even use alligators as a means of security, with most large datacentres and providers providing 5 levels or rings of physical security. Digital security would mean isolating traffic between north/south and east/west data paths, using security data protocols such as SSH and HTTPS, firewalls and encryption. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cloud base computing has seen a net gain of IT jobs and a net shift in job positions. As more and more businesses move to a cloud-based model and the use of public cloud-based providers, onsite roles within a business have changed from being task specific and supportive (managing hardware, installing and maintaining software and networking systems), to a broader skill set of monitoring, analysis, leadership, strategy and automation. Cloud based IT skills, such as cloud-based developer tools, communication software and relationship management software are projected to be the most in demand skills required by 2025.&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 id="isPasted">
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">How Will This Affect You&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Friends, family, and individuals will need to increase their digital presence to remain competitive at work and socially inclusive. A greater understanding of the emerging and current technology requirements will be needed. It will be important that older generations are not forgotten or left behind in a society where individuals have a greater reliance on technology.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cloud based applications and services already have a large presence in today’s world. From communication and socialisation to shopping, entertainment, and even education.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>AI driven analytics and research hosted in the cloud, now play an important role in social media and shopping with Meta (1) now taking it further with online avatars. Users will be able to create an online presence in a digital world that represents their physical form. Virtual Reality and augmented reality will be used to display and interact digitally with the world and with others. Shopping for clothes and other personal items can take place in real time and allow users to see the items being worn before purchase. This will lead to an explosion of related industries and business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The metaverse will tie in with social media platforms, streaming and entertainment applications, communication, and education. As more and more businesses move to cloud-based models where enormous databases of user information are held and applications designed to be accessed and available by whomever and wherever in the world, larger and more energy efficient means of data storage and processing will be required. This will see an increase cloud related IT jobs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Most individuals now have access to the World Wide Web using a handheld phone or tablet (2). As users build a more identifiable digital footprint, it will create the need for greater amounts of data stored, data transmission needs and higher levels of security. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Businesses will need a greater understanding and implementation of electronic and mobile commerce. (3) Specific applications to meet the needs of electronic shopping, communication and education will need to continue to be developed and purchased by individuals.&nbsp;</p>

            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Introduction&nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Our reliance on technology in contemporary society has resulted in the need for an increase in awareness of how our digital footprints can be used to access private and proprietary data. To mitigate the risk of cyber threats, many organisations have implemented a branch within their IT department dedicated to protecting proprietary digital assets. &nbsp;This branch is commonly referred to as Cybersecurity. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cybersecurity, as a subset of IT, is a collection of technologies, processes and information to protect all types of confidential systems, devices and programs within various networks from cyber threats, vulnerabilities and attacks. Cyberthreats refer to malicious hackers from inside and outside of organisations employing data breaches, with the intent to steal proprietary data and information (CompTIA, n.d.). This report will discuss technological developments and strategies used to minimise security risks in IT.&nbsp;</p>

            </span>
          </h3>
          <p>The state of Cybersecurity is continuously evolving, as are changes in privacy laws, procedures for the protection of classified information, along with demands and expectations on businesses and individuals. The five main ways of upholding the highest cybersecurity standards are listed below. (Rosentha, 2018).&nbsp;</p>

          <p id="isPasted">The most recent technological development in Cybersecurity is Machine Learning (ML). Machine Learning is the application of development and manipulation of patterns, by taking in vast amounts of information and data using algorithms to present all possible outcomes and scenarios of cyber threats and attacks (Perlman, 2022). Other technological developments within Machine Learning is its collaboration with Artificial Intelligence (AI). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Just as cybersecurity is a subset of IT, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Although it is common for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to be used interchangeably, Machine Learning’s disciplined focus is to take human knowledge and commands while learning from it, resulting in accuracy and unbiased decision-making. &nbsp;In contrast, Artificial Intelligence has a higher cognitive process which requires creativity and the ability to accumulate knowledge, which results in the probability of success of an application, process or system. &nbsp; (Reference or two needed here)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Artificial Intelligence is highly regarded in that it is adaptable and cost saving. McKinsey’s report discusses the functional features of Artificial Intelligence such as service-operations optimization, Artificial Intelligence based enhancements of products, predictive service and intervention and customer-service analytics (McKinsey &amp; Company, 2017). &nbsp;The research also indicates a growth of over 30% in Artificial Intelligence based implementations, as well as a generous 35-billion-dollar investment in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning for these crucial cyber security elements (Perkowski, n.d.).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Telstra is an example of an organisation that has implemented the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. They have stated that the combination of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has enhanced better overall customer experience with their products and services (Telstra Corporation Limited, 2022). &nbsp;This is achieved by upholding their commitment to Responsible Artificial Intelligence in consideration of Artificial Intelligence Ethics Principles (Australian Government, 2022), through the application of language processing, image recognition and network performance whilst predicting faults and issues for a quicker rectification and improvement. Specifically, Telstra has blocked more than 522 million text message scams in the past year and 26 million scam calls in 2022 as part of its Cleaner Pipes initiative combining Artificial Intelligence and user-enabled rulesets (Giannelis, 2022).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In addition, The Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is one of many agencies that support businesses and individuals alike. &nbsp;They do this by promoting and upholding the right to protect personal information with their provided assets of policies, laws and guidelines (OAIC, 2022).&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to everything and with anyone connected to the internet, they are at risk of cyber-attacks especially those who are not well educated in the matter become endangered to those vulnerabilities and require cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
