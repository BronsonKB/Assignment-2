            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Project Summary &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>There are many applications in the market, especially as most people now own a smart device. An article written by Mansoor Iqball suggests that there over 7 million apps now available on both Apple Store and Google Play (Mansoor Iqball, 2022). These applications are available to download, and range from social media and dating apps, fitness apps, along with streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. &nbsp;There are even mobile apps and video games designed for people to play on the go. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, we have identified a hobby activity that has limited applications, namely knitting and crocheting with yarn. Our team’s project idea is to develop an application for mobile phones and tablets, where an individual can keep track of the location of their yarn in their home, as well a database to keep the details about the yarn they have in their home.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Overview &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Crocheting and knitting are hobbies that millions of people worldwide enjoy (2022). &nbsp;These relaxing hobbies allow people to create items such as clothing, blankets, household items and even patterns and designs which can be displayed and framed on walls. One of the design challenges when knitting or crocheting is working out if there is enough yarn to complete a project, as well as trying to work out colours that work well together. Various projects require different amounts of yarn and finding out exactly how much yarn is needed to create that jumper as an extra-large size may not be readily available on the internet. This can result in too little yarn being purchased which can delay the project.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Another issue that those who knit, or crochet can experience is buying a lot more than is needed for a particular project. This can result in spare yarn from a completed project being stored somewhere around the house in storage boxes either under furniture, in wardrobes or other locations around the house. Overtime, there is a good chance of the individual forgetting where they stored the yarn, which can, in turn, lead to purchasing more yarn than is required for the next project. Our team, Woolly Web, aims to create a database in which the user can keep track of where their yarn is stored in their house, as well a variety of relevant details, so that an individual knows where they have stored the yarn, as well as what kind they have.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Motivation &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Knitting and crocheting has always been a popular past time or hobby. Along with more that 28 million people worldwide who knit or crochet (2022) one of our group members crochets as a hobby. In recent times, crocheting (2022) and knitting (Mark, 2022) have increased in popularity as a way of reducing stress and anxiety associated with Covid. This popularity has been further increased with high profile personalities such as Michelle Obama (Login • Instagram, 2022) and UK diver, Tom Daly (Made With Love By Tom Daley, 2022), sharing their skills on social media. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This has resulted in a surge on social media groups relating to these hobbies. An example, during Covid, the Instagram page for We are Knitters grew to about 3 million followers. (Lois Alter Mark, 2020). Our team’s project idea to develop an application for mobile phones and tablets, where an individual can keep track of the location of their yarn or wool in their home, as well a database to keep the details about the yarn they have in their home, taps into this growing market.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Description &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>The app will have several features. Some features will be free, while others will be premium features that will be locked behind a paywall. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The main feature of the will be a database system where users can enter different pieces of information about materials and yarn they have at home, as well as kits and current and completed projects the user is working on. At this stage of development, the database will have three tabs at the top of the page, so that users can sort their yarn, kits and projects in progress or completed separately. It will appear as a list and users can tap their selected entry to find out more about their materials. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The first tab will be about the material I.e., the yarn, and the information that will appear for yarn will include the following:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brand name (if available)</li>
            <li>Colour</li>
            <li>Length or weight remaining</li>
            <li>Fibre Type e.g., acrylic, cotton, cotton/bamboo blend etc.</li>
            <li>Yarn weight (thickness)&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Quantity of balls remaining &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Where it is stored in the house&nbsp;</li>
            <li>A photo to include as a picture&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The next tab will be for users to add their kits in the database. These could be kits which the user may have purchased to make a particular pattern or object, or it could be a kit that the user has put together themselves as a future project. &nbsp;It will also include the knitting needles or crochet hooks required for the project. The below will be the types of information that can be entered for kits:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name of Kit</li>
            <li>Photo of the box the kit is stored in</li>
            <li>Location of where it is stored</li>
            <li>Progress of completion (this would be either be not started, in progress or completed)</li>
            <li>Size of knitting needles or crochet hooks (in mm)</li>
            <li>Photo of the needles or hooks (can be a photo of the box they are stored in)</li>
            <li>Location these are stored&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The third tab in the database will be a section where users can enter their own projects that they are working on. &nbsp;This will be done by creating a new project through themselves through the app, or by browsing through an existing catalogue where users can select a project and add it to their profile. &nbsp;Creating a new project will confirm that they are currently ‘working’ on creating a particular item. When adding a project to their database, the options will include:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name of the Project</li>
            <li>Type of item being created e.g., blanket, clothing and type of clothing, household item etc.</li>
            <li>Start Date</li>
            <li>Status of the Project (When completed is selected, the completion date will be filled in automatically)&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The projects will be sorted in a completed tab once marked as completed, so that users can easily sort which projects are current and which ones have been completed. A picture of the completed project can also then be uploaded. This will allow the user to look back or share the completed item.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The second feature of the app will be a mapping system. &nbsp;This mapping system will allow the user to create a layout of their home. From here, rooms can be labelled, which will allow a user to look up a layout of their home to easily identify where the material and kits have been stored around the house. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The app will be free to download on the app store or Google Play Store. Most of the features will be available for all users but there will be a monetised element. &nbsp;We will implement this by having a storage limit to the database, where users can store a limited number of kits and yarn in their app e.g., free users may have up to 50 different entries. &nbsp;This would also mean that users could sign into their Google Accounts, Facebook accounts or create their own account within the app, so that they can view their own database anytime, anywhere. Small advertisements which appear as like a small box on the bottom of the screen will also be present, as well as other premium features which will be locked behind a once off payment. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>These premium features may include the permanent removal of advertisements and advanced guides or tutorials, where users can watch to learn more skills or brush up on crochet or knitting techniques. The database limit will also be removed, meaning that users with premium access can store as much data as they wish. The catalogue in the 3rd tab, projects, will also be extended from just one page, meaning that users will be able to browse more projects if they are needing inspiration. The cost for these premium features is still to be determined.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We also have the option to sign into Google or Facebook accounts to ensure the users data is saved on a cloud. This would mean that the user can access their data between devices which is useful for when phones or devices are upgraded.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our Woolly Web App does have some features in common with current apps. &nbsp;We are Knitters (We are Knitters, 2022) is a site that allows users to purchase kits, materials and yarn, as well as tutorials on how to knit and crochet. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and etc allow content creators to post videos of tips and tricks, as well as videos of themselves creating their own projects like clothing items or patterns which users can watch and follow. Finally, Stash2Go (10 Crochet Apps You Need to Try, 2022) is a similar app which stores projects and kits in a database like our app. However, our Woolly Web App is different, as we will also have a database for yarn materials as well the map which pinpoints where the materials are in a household. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The below will be the steps taken when the team starts developing the app.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Obtain the relevant tools needed to develop the app</li>
            <li>Design the UI (User Interface) of the app so that it looks appealing</li>
            <li>Develop the database for the 3 features (Materials, Kits, Projects)</li>
            <li>Test the database and it ensure that it works for both viewing and adding additional entries</li>
            <li>Add the ability to upload videos</li>
            <li>Test the map</li>
            <li>Add Premium Features (such as the advanced tutorials)</li>
            <li>Final Test &amp; Debugging</li>
            <li>Launch App&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Tools and Technologies&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>The project will mainly be an app. A website would also be ideal for marketing and the downloading of tutorials. The project will also need a database, web server, and front end. This project could use any combination of tools to achieve this, but we believe that the ideal tools would be MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This combination of tools is known as the MERN stack (Islam, 2022).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The main reason for using React.js is that if React Native is used, the mobile app and website can be deployed from a single codebase. React is used for reactive websites, where content can be dynamically updated. This feature of React is not of highest importance to the app. &nbsp;However, the components feature of React is of highest importance. Components are modular and re-usable parts of a website (React Components, 2022). As an example, Uber Eats uses React for this purpose (Lewis and Dean, 2022). If you were to search for food in Melbourne on Uber Eats, each restaurant and menu item uses a component to display the information about the restaurant and its food. Uber Eats does not have to write code for each item. They simply use the corresponding components and add the description, title, and pictures as parameters to pass to the component. Our Woolly Web Abb would operate in a similar way, where every tutorial uses the same component and has its content passed to it as parameters. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Express.js and Node.js work together to form the backend of the project. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to be used to write server code while Express.js is a library that makes Node.js easier to use (Node.js vs Express.js - GeeksforGeeks, 2022). The Node server will be written in the style of an Application Programming Interface (API). Using HTTP requests, the React frontend and the Node backend will communicate with each other. While it is possible to use a React frontend with any backend, and it is similarly possible to use a Node/Express backend with any frontend, the two are well suited for each other. &nbsp;The reason for this is that both use JavaScript and the React DOM (Document Object Model) even has many built-in components that are to be used with Node (Kasundra, 2022). &nbsp;As stated earlier, the server will be written as an API. This will make the app far easier to modify and change when required. API’s are another one of Node’s strong features, as Node is lightweight and able to handle many simultaneous requests. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>MongoDB will be used to store data in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is a good fit for the project as it is better than SQL at storing ‘one to many’ data (Yu, n.d.). This means that many different pieces of data will be created by, and related, to a single user. For example, Twitter uses JSON as users may have many tweets from a one account. The JSON format is also a good fit for both React and Node/Express. Many of React’s functions require JSON to be used and data from JSON objects can very easily be used by the Node backend. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Skills Required &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>The technical skills required include:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>JavaScript libraries</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Express.js</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>Database structuring/engineering</li>
            <li>Database and backend security</li>
            <li>Frontend design</li>
            <li>Knowledge of cloud computing services</li>
            <li>API structure (REST)</li>
            <li>API usage Email services (Mailchimp)</li>
            <li>Oauth 2.0</li>
            <li>Payment APIs&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Security is of foremost importance in any app that stores user data. We acknowledge that our team may not yet have the skills to store sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information with a high level of security. That is why all handling of passwords and payment information will be done with third party platforms such as OAuth and Stripe.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Outcome &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>In developing the Woolly Web App, it will allow the user to easily keep track of their inventory in terms of what they have, how much yarn they have left and where it is stored within their household. Over time, our team would hope that the app becomes popular and recommended for both beginners and experienced crocheters and knitters. &nbsp;The Woolly Web app will allow them to learn techniques, practise additional skills and techniques that they may need or would like, as well as keeping on top of their inventory so that the user doesn’t purchase more materials than needed. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>If the app becomes successful, it could have potential to branch out to other hobbies. &nbsp;This may include gaming, where a user could keep track of any hard copy games they may have and sort them via the console they are compatible with, or woodworking and building projects where the user wishes to keep track of what materials they have, the quantity and where it is stored. &nbsp;</p>
